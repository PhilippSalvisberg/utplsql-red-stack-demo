# utplsql-red-stack-demo

This repository contains the full examples used for the article named "Testen mit utPLSQL - Leicht gemacht mit SQL Developer". The article is planned to be published in issue 4/2022 of the [Red Stack Magazin](https://www.doag.org/de/mitmachen/red-stack-business-news-archiv/).

# User Story

The article is based on the following fictitious user story based on the a schema using the famous tables [`dept`](src/main/table/dept.sql) and [`emp`](src/main/table/emp.sql):

> As a HR manager, I need a table with the key figures salary total, number of employees and average salary per department to assess fairness.

# Common Setup

The scripts [`create_user.sql`](create_user.sql) is used to create an Oracle Database user named `redstack` within an Oracle Database 19c (or newer) with the necessary privilges. 

The script [`drop_user.sql`](drop_user.sql) drops the user `redstack` with all its content.

Both scripts must be executed as user `SYS`. 

All other scripts are meant to be executed as user `redstack`.

# Solution Variants

The following solution variants are implemented:

Id | Name  | Description
-- | ----- | -----------
A  | DIY   | A do-it-yourself solution using a table, PL/SQL package and database triggers. It will be created step by step. Each step is represented as a branch in this repository. The tests created during the implementation of this solution can be reused for solution variant B.
B  | View  | This solution uses a simple relational view to solve the problem. It's the simpler and better solution.
C  | MView | This solution uses a set of materialized views and materialized view logs. It shows how to work around the limitations of materialized views which prohibit the use of the query used in solution variant B as base for the materialized view.

Solution variant A and B are part of the article. Solution variant C is not covered in the article. It has been crafted for completeness.

Branch comparisons are used to visualize the changes between solution variants and steps within a solution variant.

Use the script `install.sql` to install a variant as user `redstack`.
